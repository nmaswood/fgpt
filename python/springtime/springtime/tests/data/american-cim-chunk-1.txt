indirect subsidiary of American Real Estate Partners, L.P. (“AREP”) (NYSE:  ACP), currently owns 
and operates four distinct gaming and entertainment properties in Nevada, one of the most favorable 
and stable gaming markets in the world. 

 Stratosphere Casino Hotel & Tower.  One of the most recognized landmarks on the Las 
Vegas Strip, the “Must See” resort caters to visitors to Las Vegas. 

 Arizona Charlie’s Decatur and Arizona Charlie’s Boulder.  Well-known casinos in their 
respective marketplaces, the properties are located off-Strip and cater primarily to residents of 
the fast growing Las Vegas metropolitan market. 

 Aquarius Casino Resort.  The largest hotel in the Laughlin market with more than 1,900

visitors from Southern California and Arizona and locals from Laughlin, Nevada. 

Overall, each property offers customers a value-oriented experience by providing quality hotel 
accommodations, competitive odds in the casinos and a variety of dining facilities.  Furthermore, 
the Stratosphere and Aquarius offer value-oriented, well-regarded entertainment attractions and 
amenities.

programs and are well positioned within their respective markets to benefit from these significant 
investments.

(1) Stratosphere completed a 1,000 room hotel room expansion in June 2001. 

Beginning in 2005 and continuing throughout 2006, the Company embarked upon a comprehensive 
capital improvement program, aimed at enhancing the position of each property in its respective 
market.  As a result of this initiative, the properties experienced temporary construction disruptions, 
which, in conjunction with a modest softening in the Las Vegas market overall, led to a modest 
decline in operating performance in 2006. 

Virtually all of the Company’s capital improvement programs are now complete, and management 
believes each of the properties are now poised to capitalize on these improvements going forward.

Investment Considerations 
 Strategically located, diversified portfolio of casino assets in the most stable 
gaming regulatory jurisdiction in the world, in one of the fastest growing 
gaming markets in the US. 

 Las Vegas assets are well-positioned to cater to both Tourists and the Locals 
Market. 

 Compelling development opportunity on the Las Vegas Strip on 
approximately 17 acres of land located adjacent to the Stratosphere. 

 A recently completed approximately $50 million capital improvement 
program has positioned all four properties for renewed growth in their 
respective markets. 

 Unique opportunity to exploit the growing Laughlin market, with the 
recently acquired and newly repositioned Aquarius Resort & Casino 
(formerly the Flamingo Laughlin), the largest hotel in Laughlin with 1,907 
hotel rooms. 

 Emphasis on slot play, in conjunction with relatively low maintenance 
capital expenditures, produces strong, predictable free cash flow.

Investment Considerations 

A recently completed approximately $50 million capital improvement program has positioned all 
four properties for renewed growth in their respective markets. 

Stratosphere 

 Having recently completed the renovation of all of the original 1,444 hotel rooms, the 
Stratosphere now boasts the newest room offerings north of Wynn Las Vegas. 

 The Stratosphere’s newly renovated room product is poised to capture an even greater share of 
its targeted customer base, as the supply of affordable hotel accommodations continues to 
shrink. 
•  No new comparable room product is scheduled to come online in the Stratosphere’s core market
